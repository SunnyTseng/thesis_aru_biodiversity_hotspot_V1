# thesis_aru_biodiversity_hotspot
The chapter 4 of my PhD thesis. This is the updated version comparing to the original repository. We incorporated the following changes:

- The most up to date BirdNET model (V2.4) was used to analyze data from 2020 to 2022 breeding season!
- The goal of the study was switched from comparing eBird species to biodiversiy assessment.
